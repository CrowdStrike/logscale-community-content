## Sample configuration file for Microsoft Windows.
## This is YAML, so structure and indentation is important.
## Lines can be uncommented by removing the #. You should not need to change the number of spaces after that.
## Config options have a single #, comments have a ##. Only uncomment the single # lines if you need them.

## Uncomment if you need to manually set the directory. 
#dataDirectory: C:\ProgramData\LogScale Collector
 
sources:
  windows_events:
    type: wineventlog
    ## Add other channels by simple adding additional "name" lines.
    ## The following command can be used to find other channels:
    ## Get-WinEvent -ListLog * -EA silentlycontinue | sort-object -Property Recordcount -desc
    channels:
      - name: Application
      - name: Security
      - name: System
      - name: Windows PowerShell
      - name: ForwardedEvents
    ## You can manually specify a parser to be used here.
    ## This overrides the parser specified in the LogScale UI.
    #parser: SampleWindowsParser
    sink: logscale
     
sinks:
  logscale:
    type: humio
    token: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
    ## Replace with the "Ingest URL" on the FLC download page. It must include the "https://" at the beginning.   
    url: https://XXX.YYY.ZZZ
    ## Keep this option as "none" unless you actually need a proxy.
    proxy: none
    ## The TLS option can be uncommented if you're using a self-signed certificate.
    ## This generally isn't needed unless it's a self-hosted instance. 
    #tls:
      #insecure: true     
    ## This sets the maximum single event size to 8 MB. You can change as needed.
    #maxEventSize: 8388608
    ## Uncomment if you would like to force a specific level of gzip compression. 9 is the highest.
    #maxBatchSize: 16777216
    #compression: gzip
    #compressionLevel: 9
    ## Uncomment if you want to use disk for event queue storage instead of memory.
    ## Please note this will be much slower than a memory queue.
    #queue:
      #type: disk
      #fullAction: pause
      #maxLimitInMB: 4096
    ## Add more workers to processing. The default is 4 workers. 
    ## This can be increased if FLC is falling behind on processing.
    #workers: 8
