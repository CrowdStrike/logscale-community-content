## Sample configuration file for Linux.
## This is YAML, so structure and indentation is important.
## Lines can be uncommented by removing the #. You should not need to change the number of spaces after that.
## Config options have a single #, comments have a ##. Only uncomment the single # lines if you need them.

## Uncomment if you need to manually set the directory.

    ## You can manually specify a parser to be used here.
    ## This overrides the parser specified in the LogScale UI.

    ## Keep this option as "none" unless you actually need a proxy.

    ## The TLS option can be uncommented if you're using a self-signed certificate.
    ## This generally isn't needed unless it's a self-hosted instance.

    ## This sets the maximum single event size to 8 MB. You can change as needed.

    ## Uncomment if you want to use disk for event queue storage instead of memory.
    ## Please note this will be much slower than a memory queue.

    ## Add more workers to processing. The default is 4 workers. 
    ## This can be increased if FLC is falling behind on processing.
