## Sample configuration file for Microsoft Windows.
## This is YAML, so structure and indentation is important.
## Lines can be uncommented by removing the #. You should not need to change the number of spaces after that.
## Config options have a single #, comments have a ##. Only uncomment the single # lines if you need them.

## Uncomment dataDirectory if you need to manually set the directory.
## Note: Not used with Data Ingest / Fleet configuration
#dataDirectory: C:\ProgramData\LogScale Collector

    ## Add other channels by simple adding additional "name" lines.
    ## The following command can be used to find other channels:
    ## Get-WinEvent -ListLog * -EA silentlycontinue | sort-object -Property Recordcount -desc
