## Sample configuration file for Microsoft Windows.
## This is YAML, so structure and indentation is important.
## Lines can be uncommented by removing the #. You should not need to change the number of spaces after that.
## Config options have a single #, comments have a ##. Only uncomment the single # lines if you need them.

## Uncomment dataDirectory if you need to manually set the directory.
## Note: Not used with Data Ingest / Fleet configuration
#dataDirectory: C:\ProgramData\LogScale Collector
 
sources:
  # Collect windows event logs
  windows_events:

    ## Add other channels by simple adding additional "name" lines.
    ## The following command can be used to find other channels:
    ## Get-WinEvent -ListLog * -EA silentlycontinue | sort-object -Property Recordcount -desc

## For Syslog sources, you may configure multiple sources, each with unique port, protocol, and sink configurations. 

  ## Collect syslog udp 1514.

    port: 1514

    ## Optional: Bind to a specific address
    #bind: "0.0.0.0"
    ## Optional: Max allowed event size (default = 2048 bytes), messages larger than this will be truncated
    ## Increase this value if you expect larger syslog messages. 
    ## Be cautious when increasing this value, as it affects memory usage and network bandwidth.
    ## The max value is 950000 bytes.
    maxEventSize: 2048
 
  ## Collect syslog tcp 1515.
