## Sample configuration file for Linux.
## This is YAML, so structure and indentation is important.
## Lines can be uncommented by removing the #. You should not need to change the number of spaces after that.
## Config options have a single #, comments have a ##. Only uncomment the single # lines if you need them.

## Uncomment dataDirectory if you need to manually set the directory.

    ## Optional: Max allowed event size (default = 2048 bytes), messages larger than this will be truncated
    ## Increase this value if you expect larger syslog messages. 
    ## Be cautious when increasing this value, as it affects memory usage and network bandwidth.
    ## The max value is 950000 bytes.
