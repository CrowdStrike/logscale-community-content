## Sample configuration file for Microsoft Windows.
## This is YAML, so structure and indentation is important.
## Lines can be uncommented by removing the #. You should not need to change the number of spaces after that.
## Config options have a single #, comments have a ##. Only uncomment the single # lines if you need them.
