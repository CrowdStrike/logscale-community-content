      ### CrowdStrike Documentation:

      - [Set up Falcon Next-Gen SIEM](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/cffa5af8) (A high-level strategy to getting Next-Gen SIEM up and running with your data and security needs)
      - [Data Connectors](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/a76b8289) (General information on CrowdStrike's data connectors)
      - [Third-party Data Sources](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/je6a45b3) (Index on the left links to documentation for setting up ingestion for third-party solutions)
      - ⓘ *Pull connectors generally use an API to configure the data connector to "pull" the data into CrowdStrike. Push connectors generally use the LogScale collector to "push" the logs to the CrowdStrike cloud.*
      - [Get Started with Fleet Management](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/q81f4f3a)
      - [LogScale Collector](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/a2a653c67) (Thorough information on installing, configuring, troubleshooting, and more)
      - ⓘ *[Click here to watch an introduction video to Fleet Management on our Tech Hub](https://vid.crowdstrike.com/watch/cKxirC9L9pe9uHWqWLtKP4?)*

      ### Support Portal

      - [[Index] Next-Gen SIEM Data Connector troubleshooting articles](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/ka1Ns0000001mU1IAI) (Troubleshooting information for using the Falcon LogScale Collector (FLC), 3rd-party data connectors, and HTTP/HEC data connectors)

      ### LogScale documentation

      If needed, there is a lot of crossover of understanding and use cases for things like the LogScale Collector, which is used with many third-party solutions when sending their logs to CrowdStrike.
      - [Configuration file examples](https://library.humio.com/falcon-logscale-collector/log-collector-config-advanced-example.html)
      - [Install Falcon LogScale Collector](https://library.humio.com/falcon-logscale-collector/log-collector-install.html) (Information similar to what is in the CrowdStrike console for this, but there may be small nuances that can help here that may not be in the console documentation)
      - ⓘ ***Custom Install** method is the manual process of installing the log collector and managing its configuration directly on the host. **Full Install** method is the process of using Fleet Management to manage the configuration and version of the log collector from the CrowdStrike console. Please refer to the CrowdStrike console documentation if you wish to use this method.*

      \ Check the box next to \"Continue workflow on loop iteration failure\" and\
      \ click \"Next\"\n\n---\n**Step 6a**: Add a sequential ⚑ Action within the loop\n\
      \n**Step 6b**: Search for and select the CROWDSTRIKE action \"Add comment to\
      \ alert\". This will allow you to add a note to the alerts before closing them.\
      \ It is good practice to do this when automating a task so that you can confirm\
      \ this later on when looking at the closed alerts.\n\n**Step 6c**: Click on\
      \ the \"ƒx\" for the Alert ID field to add in the \"Ngsiem Alert Id instance\"\
      \ from the Event query results. Drag-and-drop \"Ngsiem Alert Id instance\" from\
      \ the WORKFLOW DATA section on the right and drop it in the expression in line\
      \ 1. Then click on \"Insert expression\".\n\n**Step 6d**: Add a comment here.\
      \ This can be anything you would like for noting the automated closing of an\
      \ alert. For example:\n```\nAlert closed automatically by workflow\n```\nOnce\
      \ you are finished adding your note, click \"Next\"\n\n---\n**Step 7a**: Add\
      \ another sequential ⚑ Action within the loop after the \"Add comment to alert\"\
      \ action\n\n**Step 7b**: Step 6b: Search for and select the CROWDSTRIKE action\
      \ \"Set detection status\"\n\n**Step 7c**: Click on the \"ƒx\" for the Detection\
      \ ID field to add in the \"Ngsiem Alert Id instance\" from the Event query results.\
      \ Drag-and-drop \"Ngsiem Alert Id instance\" from the WORKFLOW DATA section\
      \ on the right and drop it in the expression in line 1. Then click on \"Insert\
      \ expression\".\n\n**Step 7d**: Set the value of Status to \"Closed\" and click\
      \ \"Next\"\n\n---\n## 🎉 Congratulations! 🎉\n### Your workflow is now complete.\

      ### <-- Integrated Threat Intelligence
      CrowdStrike's own threat intelligence is integrated into the Next-Gen SIEM solution. This is accessible through the use of the *ioc:lookup()* function. You can use this to look up IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) of IP addresses, URLs, and domains in a local copy of CrowdStrike's curated database of IOCs and annotate the events with the associated security information.

      [Click here to read more about the parameters available, how to use this function, and what kind of information it is able to return with its results.](https://library.humio.com/data-analysis/functions-ioc-lookup.html)

      Using the [Advanced event search](/investigate/search) page, you are able to quickly and efficiently search through large amounts of data without having to wait long periods of time for results. As well, the ability to query that data is made to be very approachable to new or less experienced users.

      Check out this video tutorial on the use of the Event search and Advanced event search pages: [Feature Focus: Next-Gen SIEM - Event Search and Advanced Event Search](https://play.vidyard.com/Exm6H5iQna5vmxmSgRSDFy.html)
      - ⓘ *This video and many others are accessible within the [CrowdStrike Support Portal's **Video Tutorials** section](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/video-tutorials)*

      ## Let's start with some basic queries!
      ### String searching
      You can run simple string searches to look for that string of characters within any of the available logs. Something like an IP address is easily searched for without any special functions or field searching needed. You can easily search for words within your logs to find things like [error](/investigate/search?end=&query=error&repo=all&searchViewInteractions=NoXSA&start=7d&timezone=UTC), [failed](/investigate/search?end=&query=failed&repo=all&searchViewInteractions=NoXSA&start=7d&timezone=UTC), or [exception](/investigate/search?end=&query=exception&repo=all&searchViewInteractions=NoXSA&start=7d&timezone=UTC).
      - [Click here to search for "google.com" within your logs over the last 7 days.](/investigate/search?end=&query=google.com&repo=all&searchViewInteractions=NoXSA&start=7d&timezone=UTC)
      ### Using Regex to search
      To search for words with your logs without worrying if any of the letters are uppercase or lowercase, you can use regex to specify case-insensitivity. Here's an example:
      ```
      /powershell/i
      ```
      - [Click here to search for any logs containing "powershell" using this method over the last 7 days.](/investigate/search?end=&query=%2Fpowershell%2Fi&repo=all&searchViewInteractions=NoXSA&start=7d&timezone=UTC)
      - ⓘ *In the Advanced event search page for this, try changing the word "powershell" to another word that you want to search for within your logs.*

      ### Searching based on a specific connector or vendor
      If you wish to see all of the data coming in for a specific connector you have setup, you can do this right from [Data Onboarding](/data-connectors/).
      1. When viewing your Connections, select the three vertical dots in the **Actions** column all the way to the right of the row for the connector you wish to search on.
      2. Click on **Show events** (should be the last option in the list of Actions).
      - This will open a new Advanced event search window searching on all logs for the last hour for that connector.

      You can also use the metadata fields that are added to logs during the parsing process. Here's an example of what this looks like with CrowdStrike data:
      ```
      #Vendor = /crowdstrike/i
      ```
      - [Click here to search for CrowdStrike logs using this method.](/investigate/search?end=&query=%23Vendor%20%3D%20%2Fcrowdstrike%2Fi&repo=all&searchViewInteractions=NoXSA&start=7d&timezone=UTC)
      - ⓘ *In the Advanced event search page for this, try changing the word "crowdstrike" to the vendor name of one of the log sources you are currently ingesting.*
      - ⓘ *Note that this search uses the regex case-insensitivity technique described earlier. This is not required for this search since the vendor name should always be lowercase when added during parsing. However, getting comfortable with using this feature can help you when searching in other use cases.*

      ## 🎉 Congratulations! 🎉
      You now have the basics for starting to search through your data in the CrowdStrike console!
      - The search for the vendor name you just did is an example of searching for events mapped to a specific field.
      - Feel free to play around in the [Advanced event search](/investigate/search) page to look for information mapped to different fields within your logs.

      - [Detection Triage Dashboard](/dashboards-v2/dashboard/7F208909-8907-4F5E-8CAF-EDE8D1985611?filter=created_at%3A%27Last%2030%20days%27)
      - ⓘ ***Note**: Triaging a detection with Charlotte AI doesn’t count toward your monthly quota.*
      ### Agentic Response with Charlotte AI
      - Charlotte AI guides you through detection triage by asking high-impact questions and getting fast answers.
      ### Additional capabilities
      - Within an endpoint detection, you can deepen your investigation by analyzing the command line with Charlotte AI for an explanation of the command's behavior and effects. This analysis shows directly within the detection.

      ### [Cases](/xdr/cases)
      You can create a case to investigate one or more detections. Events found with an event query are also able to be added to a case for investigation.
      - Cases can be created with a Case template to allow for SLA setting and notification, and also custom case fields for tracking progress and organizational metrics or information related to case investigation
      - [**Watch this YouTube video showcasing how to streamline investigations using Case Management**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18r7wJftFYA)
      - A brief overview of what is available within cases is available in [release note in the Support Portal](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Release-Notes-Investigate-Suspicious-Activity-and-Orchestrate-Response-with-Next-Gen-SIEM-Cases)

      ## Create a test case using one or more detections from the Unified Detections page.
      - Check out the **Case Investigation** documentation linked below to see what options you have when investigating events and detections with the workbench.

      You can enrich data through the use of [Lookup Files](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/rdb0abf5). This allows you to enhance your queries with a table of information to aid in threat hunting or general searching.

      An excellent example of this is the *[falcon/helper/mappings.csv](/investigate/search/lookup-files/falcon%2Fhelper%2Fmappings.csv?repoOrViewName=search-all)* lookup file. This can be used to make the data from your query more easily understood.

      ### [Check out this Cool Query Friday post on our Reddit page to see how this can be used to enrich information in your queries!](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/18off35/20231222_cool_query_friday_new_feature_in_raptor/)
      - ⓘ *Lookup files can be viewed, created, and edited in the [Lookup Files page](/investigate/search/lookup-files).*

      Being able to effectively use the CrowdStrike Query Language allows for better threat hunting, rule creation, dashboarding, and more.

      To help improve your understanding of the use of this, the following documentation provides excellent guidance of learning this by using the different functions available:
      - [Learn the CrowdStrike Query Language by Example](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/a4cc00c2)
      - [Learn the CrowdStrike Query Language Using Falcon Data](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/f22f03a6)

      ### Not seeing a data connector for your solution?
      **Logs are able to be brought into Next-Gen SIEM using one of our [Generic data connectors](/data-connectors/add-connection?filter=vendor_name%3A%27Generic%27).**

      - **ⓘ Check out the "Generic Log Ingestion - Push Connector" Tech Hub Video to see how these can be set up**

      **When using a Generic data connector, a parser must be selected to normalize the logs for use within the console. You can choose from one of our [Default parsers](/content-library/catalog/parser) available, or build your own parser with the help of our [AI generated parsing](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/q83fb13b) with a sample of the logs you wish to bring in.**

      ⓘ *There are quite a few parsers available for products that there may not be a data connector built for today. Review these to see if a Generic data connector can be used to bring that solution's logs into Next-Gen SIEM.*
