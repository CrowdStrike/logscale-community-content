# Community Content

Welcome to the Community Content Repository. This covers both NG-SIEM and LogScale. 

To keep it simple, we'll just use the name *CQL Community Content* for this repo. What is CQL? It's the CrowdStrike Query Language used in both NG-SIEM and LogScale. There is content in here that applies to both. 

This repository contains community and field contributed content which includes:
 - Complete Packages
 - Queries
 - Dashboards
 - Alerts
 - Lookup Files
 
 ...as well as Tutorials and FAQs.
 
**NOTE:** These are not meant as replacements for the [official documentation](https://library.humio.com) or the [LogScale Package Marketplace](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/packages-marketplace.html). However, please feel free to use and contribute as much as you'd like.
